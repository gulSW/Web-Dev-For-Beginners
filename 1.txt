Assignment
Web developers would use tools because of their specific needs. Here I tried to explain the usage purpose 
of 3 tools.
-Bundlers/packagers: These are tools that get your code ready for production. 
Parcel and Webpack are popular packaging tools.
-Testing tools: These generally take the form of a tool that will automatically run tests against your 
code to make sure it is correct before you go any further.
-Deployment tools: Deployment systems allow you to get your website published, are available for both static and dynamic sites,
 and commonly tend to work alongside testing systems.
